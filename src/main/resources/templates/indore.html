    <p class="text-start m-5">The city was built by Rajgopalpur Infrastructure and MMB Infrastructure, who worked together.
        About 600 kilometers of dedicated multilane roads are planned for Indore in the city’s Master Plan.
        By 2021, the city’s infrastructure will be upgraded to make it the world’s smartest place to live.
        In addition to other development plans, Indore has set a goal to have 2,000 to 3,000 cars pass through the city every day.
        It will also help to have a 24-hour automated emergency response control center, an online health clinic, a library that can be accessed from all over the world, and smart parking and stormwater management.</p>
