    <p class="text-start m-5">In India, most of the money is spent on building things for cities.
        In Maharashtra, Thane is the best city to live in if you want to be smart.
        If you take the 2015 census, it was the fifth-largest city in Asia with 60.6 million people.
        Thane has the most “smart buildings” in Maharashtra, where Thane is.
        The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), the Indian Institute of Technology – Bombay (IIT – BHEL), and many MNCs and big banks are all in Thane.
        Some of India’s best-known tourist attractions are also found in the area, like the Girgaum Chowpatty, Worli Sea Face, and the Marine Drive.</p>
